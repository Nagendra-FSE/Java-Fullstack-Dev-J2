4. Block Vs. Inline Elements

block : A block-level element always takes up the full width available. A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.


Inline Elements: Inline elements occupy only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.
