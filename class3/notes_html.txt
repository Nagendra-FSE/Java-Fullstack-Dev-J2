======================= HTML Semantics ==================

Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags that describe the purpose of content on a webpage, enhancing accessibility, SEO, and readability by clearly conveying the structure to browsers and assistive technologies.

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>


<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>


<header> - The <header> tag defines the top section of a webpage or section, typically containing titles or navigational links.

<footer> - The <footer> tag defines the bottom section of a webpage or section, typically containing copyright information, links, or disclaimers.

<nav> - The <nav> tag defines a section of navigation links, helping users and search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of the website.

<main> - The <main> tag designates the primary content of a webpage, focusing on the main topic and excluding repeated elements like headers, footers, or sidebars.

<section> - The <section> tag defines a distinct section of content within a webpage, typically grouping related content together with its own heading.

<article> - The <article> tag represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article, that can stand alone or be distributed independently.

<details> - The <details> tag creates a collapsible section that users can expand to view additional information, improving content organization and user interaction.

<aside> - The <aside> tag represents content related to the main content but placed separately, like sidebars, pull quotes, or related links.

<summary> - The <summary> tag provides a clickable summary or heading for a <details> element, which expands to reveal additional content when clicked.

What is CSS? Cascading Style Sheets

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and layout web pages. It controls the design, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to enhance the appearance of HTML elements across different devices and screen sizes.

inline css: Inline styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. They are useful for quick, specific styling but aren't scalable for larger projects.

style="width: 80%; margin: 50px auto 60px; background-color: blanchedalmond";


internal styles: Internal styles are declared inside a <style> tag within the HTML document's <head>. They affect only the elements on that specific page.


extrenal style sheet: External stylesheets are separate .css files linked to HTML documents. They allow for consistent styling across multiple pages and are ideal for larger, scalable projects.
